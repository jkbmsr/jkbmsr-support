# JKBMSR Support & Compatibility Community

This repo is the community hub for [JKBMSR](https://jkbmsr.com) — the place to
report bugs, report and confirm whether a specific BMS model works with
JKBMSR firmware, and discuss anything else related to setup, wiring, or
firmware behavior.

There's no code here. Everything happens in **[Discussions](../../discussions)**
and **[Issues](../../issues)**.

## Reporting a bug

Bugs across all three JKBMSR products are reported **here**, not in each
product's own repo — [open a new issue](../../issues/new/choose) and pick the
template for the affected product:

- **Firmware** — the ESP32 gateway firmware
- **Web app / dashboard** — jkbmsr.com and the authenticated dashboard
- **Mobile app** — the Android/iOS app

Each template applies the matching label (`firmware`, `web-app`, or
`mobile-app`) automatically. If you're not sure whether your BMS model is
supported at all, that's a compatibility question for Discussions below, not
a bug report.

## Compatibility discussions

Discussions are organized into one category per supported BMS vendor:

- **JK-BMS**
- **Daly**
- **JBD (Jiabaida)**
- **Seplos**

If you've tried JKBMSR with a specific model, open a new discussion in that
vendor's category with the exact model number in the title (e.g.
`JK-B2A24S — confirmed working over Bluetooth`) and describe what you tested
(connection type, cell count, firmware version, what worked and what didn't).
Other owners with the same or a similar model can reply and confirm.

## How this feeds back into the site

Reports confirmed in Discussions are what's behind the **Community Verified**
labels on [jkbmsr.com/compatibility](https://jkbmsr.com/compatibility). A
model showing up there as community-verified means real owners reported it
working, not that JKBMSR's maintainer tested that exact unit.
